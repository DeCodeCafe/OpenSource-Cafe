# Ayush Kumar

I’m a software engineer by profession and a builder by heart; aligned towards web development and tooling. I’m presently a pre final year student at ABES ENGINEERING COLLEGE GHAZIABAD U.P, pursuing my ECE-undergrad degree. I believe that one’s knowledge amplifies when shared; and thus writing technical blogs and delivering tech-talks is something that I am passionate about. Not bound by a particular technology, I consider myself dynamic and quick-learner when it comes to development and focus more on solutions of the problem. Though, I love to play on my strengths to contribute the most I can; be it work or a side-project. I believe challenges are the best teachers and can help one get beyond the comfort-zone and witness growth.

I am Github Campus Expert and also I am Google Summer of Code 22 Student with Fossology Organization, Apart from this I am Content Technical Writer at Alan AI and I write daily and weekly blogs on Hashnode and Medium.

I have previously worked as a Full-Stack Developer at two or three FinTech startup; and have got exposure to end-to-end product-development. I am also fond of Developer Communities and I don’t miss any chance to involve myself in organizing, volunteering and helping my fellow developers there. Also, I have served as a mentor and Project admin at various open-source programs like  GSSoC’22, HSOC22 PSOC21 and many more assisted 2000+ coders to get started in open-source. I am a budding open-source contributor and looking forward to exploring more in this area.
